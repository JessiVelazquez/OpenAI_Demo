# OpenAI Demo

Hosted at: [https://open-ai-demo-jessi.herokuapp.com/](https://open-ai-demo-jessi.herokuapp.com/)

Little demo app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to begin playing around with OpenAI's public API. Started from a tutorial ([quickstart tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)), and building further on my own.


## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 14.6.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-node
   ```

4. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
6. Add your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the `.env` file

7. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
